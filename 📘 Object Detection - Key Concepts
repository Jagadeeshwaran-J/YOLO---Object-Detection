# 📘 Object Detection Training - Key Concepts Explained

This document explains key concepts used during the training of object detection models like YOLO or RT-DETR in a simple and clear manner.

---

## 🎯 Precision
**Definition:**  
Precision tells how many of the detected objects were actually correct.  

**Formula:**  
`Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)`

**Example:**  
If the model detects 10 objects and 7 are correct, precision = 70%

---

## 📈 Recall
**Definition:**  
Recall tells how many of the actual objects were detected by the model.

**Formula:**  
`Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)`

**Example:**  
If 10 objects are present and only 6 are detected, recall = 60%

---

## ⚡ AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision)
**Definition:**  
A technique that mixes float16 and float32 precision during training to improve speed and reduce GPU memory usage.

**Usage:**  
Set `amp=True` during training.

---

## 🏆 mAP (Mean Average Precision)
**Definition:**  
Main metric to evaluate object detection performance.

- `mAP@0.5`: Intersection over Union (IoU) ≥ 0.5  
- `mAP@0.5:0.95`: Average over multiple IoU thresholds (more strict)

**Higher mAP means better detection accuracy.**

## 📦 Box / Cls / DFL Loss
**Box Loss:** Error in predicted bounding box.  
**Cls Loss:** Error in predicted class label.  
**DFL (Distribution Focal Loss):** Predicts bounding boxes more accurately by using a probability distribution.

---

## 🔧 lr0 (Initial Learning Rate)
**Definition:**  
The starting speed at which the model learns.  
Too high = unstable learning. Too low = very slow learning.

---

## 🔁 lrf (Learning Rate Final)
**Definition:**  
The final learning rate at the end of training. Used with learning rate scheduling.

**Usage:**  
Helps the model settle slowly and avoid overshooting.

---

## 📉 cos_lr (Cosine Learning Rate Scheduler)
**Definition:**  
Smoothly reduces the learning rate from high to low using a cosine curve.

**Benefit:**  
Fast learning in the beginning and fine-tuning at the end.

---

## 🧰 Regularization
**Definition:**  
Techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

**Common Methods:**
- Weight decay (L2 regularization)
- Dropout
- Early stopping

---

## ⚖️ Normalization
**Definition:**  
Scaling inputs/features (like pixel values) to a consistent range (e.g., 0–1).

**Benefit:**  
Stabilizes and accelerates model training.

---

## 🌍 Generalization
**Definition:**  
The ability of a model to perform well on new, unseen data.

**Goal of training:**  
Avoid overfitting by generalizing beyond training data.
