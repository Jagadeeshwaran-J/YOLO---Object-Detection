## 🔍 **Key Metrics for YOLO Object Detection**

1. ### 📈 **Losses**

   YOLO models usually show these losses during training:

   * **Box loss (Localization loss)** – how well the predicted bounding box fits the ground truth.
   * **Objectness loss** – how confident the model is that an object exists in a bounding box.
   * **Classification loss** – how accurate the predicted class is for each object.

   **👉 Lower loss values over time = model is learning.**

2. ### 📊 **mAP (mean Average Precision)** – THE MOST IMPORTANT METRIC

   * mAP\@0.5: This checks how accurate the model is when the predicted box overlaps with the ground truth by at least 50%.
   * mAP\@0.5:0.95: A more strict version. Averages mAP from IoU 0.5 to 0.95 in steps of 0.05.

   **👉 Higher mAP = better detection performance.**

   * **>70% mAP\@0.5 is usually considered good**
   * **>90% is excellent**, depending on the use case.

3. ### 🧠 **Precision & Recall**

   * **Precision**: Out of all the detections, how many are correct.
   * **Recall**: Out of all the ground-truth objects, how many were detected.

   **F1-score** combines both. Good models maintain a balance (Precision ↑, Recall ↑).

## 📉 **Learning Curves to Monitor**

Tools like **TensorBoard**, **WandB**, or even `results.png` in YOLOv5/YOLOv8 output can help you visualize:

| Metric Curve       | Good Behavior           | Bad Behavior                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Training loss      | Decreases steadily      | Stays high / fluctuates wildly  |
| Validation loss    | Decreases or stabilizes | Increases (overfitting)         |
| mAP (val)          | Increases and plateaus  | Stays low / random jumps        |
| Precision / Recall | Improve with training   | Stay flat or drop after a point |

## ✅ How to Know if the Model is Well-Trained

| Checkpoint                      | Signs of Good Model                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Final training loss             | Lower than initial, and stable                    |
| mAP\@0.5                        | >70% (for general object detection tasks)         |
| Overfitting                     | Val loss ≈ Train loss, mAP on val is high         |
| Confusion matrix (if available) | Low number of false positives and false negatives |
| Inference results (visually)    | Accurate and tight bounding boxes                 |

## 📌 Conclusion

To **evaluate if your YOLO model is good**:

* Look for **decreasing training & validation loss**
* Check for **high mAP** (especially mAP\@0.5)
* Make sure **precision and recall are balanced**
* Visually inspect the detection results
* Watch for signs of **overfitting** (val loss increases while train loss decreases)
